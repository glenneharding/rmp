        <h1>The Future of RMP</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">These are the long-term goals planned for the RMP project once the artwork is complete.</p>

        <div class="goal">
            <h2>1. Reprints and Other Products</h2>
            <p>Once the mural is completed, the first step will be to create high-quality reprints and derivative products. These could include posters, canvas prints, books, and merchandise to help share the message of the RMP with a broader audience while also supporting its ongoing mission.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="goal">
            <h2>2. The RMP Mobile App</h2>
            <p>A dedicated app will offer an interactive way for people to engage with the mural digitally. It could include detailed zoom-in features, narration, behind-the-scenes insights, and educational content to enhance accessibility and reach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="goal">
            <h2>3. The RMP Video and Book Reading</h2>
            <p>Plans include producing a narrated video that walks through the mural and its themes, along with a published book that captures the full story. These formats will make the content available in both visual and literary forms, perfect for sharing in schools, churches, or events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="goal">
            <h2>4. Ultimate Goal – The Mural</h2>
            <p>The ultimate vision is to have the mural installed in a large, permanent space where people can experience it in full scale. This would be the culmination of years of work—bringing the RMP to life as a monumental public work that tells its story in a powerful, immersive way.</p>
